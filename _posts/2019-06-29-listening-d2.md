### 3> Organising a group project
Cara: So for our group project, do you want to start this week?
Selim: Yeah, I want to start early so we have enough time.
Robert: Me too, but I’ve got a big maths project too.
Cara: How about we meet first to plan what we’re going to do? Just for an hour.
Robert: Good idea, Cara.
Cara: When are you free?
Robert: I can always do mornings before 10.
Cara: Robert … Uh …
Selim: I’m sleeping before 10!
Robert: OK! OK, so when are you two free?
Cara: Wednesdays are good for me. But not very early, please!
Selim: I can’t do the mornings on Wednesdays but I have 3 till 5 free.
Robert: I can do 4 o’clock, just before my maths class.
Cara: Great, 4 then. Where shall we meet?
Selim: The library?
Robert: I don’t know. The library isn’t a good place for a planning meeting as we can’t talk in
there.
Cara: How about the university café? It’s near the library. We can talk in there. And eat cake.
Selim: Cake is good.
Robert: OK, so Wednesday at the café. I need to leave at ten to five to go to my maths class.
Cara: No problem. Planning will take less than an hour.
Selim: OK! See you Wednesday for cake.
Robert and Cara: See you, Selim!

### 5> The first English class
Hello, everyone. Hello! It’s nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am
your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That’s L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some
information about the class.
Our class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room.
Again, that’s room 13.
We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and
lasts 90 minutes, so we finish at 6 p.m. That’s 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK?
Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I’m in office 7B on the second floor. My office
hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions or problems or want to talk to me, it’s
Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.
We begin next week, on March the 13th. That’s Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on
May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.
I think that’s all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life
and Language Level 1 Student’s Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don’t want to see
any photocopies of the book, thank you! Remember, it’s level 1 student’s book. Don’t buy the
teacher’s book.
I think that’s all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!
